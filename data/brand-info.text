- When unsure or missing info: ask for transaction ID / wallet address (do not request private keys).

Common Q&A (examples):
Q: What are your fees?
A: Our swap fee is 0.20% per trade. There may be network gas fees in addition.

Q: My transaction failed â€” where did my tokens go?
A: Tokens remain in the blockchain; if a swap reverted, no token transfer occurred. Ask for tx hash and network so we can investigate.

Q: Do you support Layer-2?
A: We support Polygon currently; Layer-2 integrations are on our roadmap.

Maintenance & roadmap snippets:
- Next release (Q4): improved transaction history UI and enhanced analytics for LP providers.
- Upcoming: optional gas optimization feature for Polygon.

Admin notes:
- Do not share internal metrics publicly (e.g., revenue, active users) without approval.
